# VirtualTourist
 
 This project has been created in partial fulfillment for Udacity - iOS Development Nanodegree.
 
 The project allows you to long-press on any location in the world, drop a pin, and view available pictures near the dropped pin. You can also delete pictures you are not interested in or fetch a new collection of pictures.
 
 To run the project: 
 1. Download the zip or clone to GitHub desktop on your MacOS device (must have xcode installed)
 2. Open the file and launch VirtualTourist.xcodeproj
 3. Press the play button on the upper left corner of the window
